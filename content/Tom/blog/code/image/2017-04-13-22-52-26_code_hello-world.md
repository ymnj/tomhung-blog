First post. Yadededede

Recently I have been diving more into CMS platforms to understand the different features supporting the management of web content.

In the past, I had always thought of CMS as synonymous with Wordpress and merely a tool for easy blog management akin to Blogger or Tumblr. It wasn't until I started learning how to develop custom theme templates for Wordpress that I realized the extent of its capabilities as a content management application. Its been somewhat of a learning curve having to work with PHP again after so long and understanding the different function hooks supplied by Wordpress, but nothing Google can't solve. Although I find the Wordpress documentation to be a little better. 

I've played with Wordpress to create a simple blog post template exactly like this current setup, as well as using the [WP REST API][1] to make requests to an instance of Wordpress and receiving post information to display on my non Wordpress project. The latter was pretty interesting and something I will potentially examine again in order to incorporate the "blog" functionality into my SPA portfolio. Because as it stands right now, having Wordpress or this current setup in a sub-directory outside of my SPA is kind of an ugly hack. Not to mention the additional  footprint of using Wordpress just to use a very limited set of its functionality is overkill. 

That's why I decided to look into a small Flat File CMS that could easily satisfy the blog requirement without the additional size of a full blown CMS filled with functions I wouldn't use. I ended up using HTMLy.![enter image description here][2]

Although I found the documentations lacking, creating a new theme especially a simple one such as this was fairly straight forward if you examine the included *twentyfifteen* theme. The future plan is to migrate everything into my Vue.js application but for now this will do.
